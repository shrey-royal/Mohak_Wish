Problem Statement:

You are tasked with designing a library management system for a public library. The system should handle the borrowing and returning of books, as well as the management of library patrons and library staff.

Requirements:

1. The system should have classes to represent different entities such as Book, Patron, and LibraryStaff.
2. Each Book should have attributes such as title, author, publication year, and availability status.
3. Patrons should be able to borrow and return books from the library. They should have attributes such as name, address, and a list of borrowed books.
4. Library staff should have attributes such as name, employee ID, and position.
5. The system should allow for method overloading to handle different types of book borrowing scenarios, such as borrowing for a specific duration or indefinitely.
6. The system should also implement method overriding to handle the calculation of fines for overdue books differently for different types of patrons (e.g., regular patrons vs. premium patrons).
7. Additionally, the system should utilize aggregation to represent the relationship between the Library and its collection of books, patrons, and staff members.
8. The system should be able to display information such as available books, borrowed books, overdue books, and fines for each patron.

Implementation:

- Create classes for Book, Patron, and LibraryStaff with appropriate attributes and methods.
- Implement method overloading for the borrowing of books, with different parameters for borrowing duration.
- Implement method overriding for calculating fines based on the type of patron.
- Use aggregation to represent the Library class, which contains arrays/lists of books, patrons, and staff members.
- Implement methods in the Library class to handle book borrowing, returning, and fine calculation.

By implementing the above requirements using inheritance, aggregation, method overloading, and method overriding in Java, you will create an efficient and scalable library management system capable of handling real-world scenarios in a public library setting.
