1. Employee Database:
   Design a data structure to represent employee records with fields like name, employee ID, department, and salary. Implement functions to add, update, and search for employees.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create an Employee Database:
   - Initialize an empty data structure, e.g., a dictionary, to store employee records. This will serve as your employee database.

2. Add Employee:
   - Create a function to add an employee to the database.
   - Accept employee details such as name, employee ID, department, and salary as parameters.
   - Check if the employee ID already exists in the database.
   - If the employee ID is not already in the database, add the employee's information to the database.
   - Return a message indicating success or failure.

3. Update Employee Information:
   - Create a function to update employee information in the database.
   - Accept the employee ID and the fields to be updated (name, department, and/or salary) as parameters.
   - Check if the employee ID exists in the database.
   - If the employee exists, update the specified fields with the new information.
   - Return a message indicating success or failure.

4. Search for Employee:
   - Create a function to search for an employee in the database.
   - Accept the employee ID as a parameter.
   - Check if the employee ID exists in the database.
   - If the employee exists, return their information (name, department, and salary).
   - If the employee is not found, return a message indicating that the employee does not exist in the database.

5. Delete Employee (Optional):
   - You can also implement a function to delete an employee from the database by providing the employee ID.
   - Check if the employee ID exists in the database.
   - If the employee exists, remove their record from the database.
   - Return a message indicating success or failure.

Here's a summary of the operations:

1. Create the database.
2. Add an employee.
3. Update an employee's information.
4. Search for an employee.
5. (Optional) Delete an employee.
