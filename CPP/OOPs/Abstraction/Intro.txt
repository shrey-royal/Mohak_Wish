Q. What is Abstraction?
> Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
> In CPP, Abstraction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.
> Using Interfaces we can achieve 100% Abstraction.
> Using Abstract classes we can achieve 0-100% Abstraction.
> Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.

There are many ways to apply Abstraction in CPP or in real life. For example, we can take a real-life example of a Rickshaw. We don't know how the Rickshaw is made, but we know how to drive it. This is called Abstraction.


1. Abstract Class
2. Interface
